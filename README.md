This repository contains a solution to John Hopkins on Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course final project composed by the following files:

* README.md: just present the other files
* CodeBook.md: talks about the original data, variables of tidy data generated by "run_analysis.R" and cleaning/transformation operations performed by this script
* run_analysis.R: script that transforms the original dataset in the desired tidy dataset
* tidy_data_set.txt: tidy dataset produced by run_analysis.R script
